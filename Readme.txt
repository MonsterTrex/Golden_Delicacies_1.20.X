Golden carrots are amazing... But imagine coming across golden bread... then golden potatoes... then golden porkchops! Well now you can using this mod. Now you can have a variety of golden food diets. Alongside this, store any vegetable type of food into crates for more visual variety and easy storage.

Food crates can be made using 9 of any vegetable foods to make a compact version of the item in the form of a block.

Golden food varieties can be made using either golden nuggets or golden ingots which is differentiated by the food being a plant and an animal based food. Each one of these golden varieties has particular buffs and benefits over others such as golden bread and cooked potatoes having the highest saturation (out of basic food groups) while golden rabbit gives you a jump boost effect for a short duration.
